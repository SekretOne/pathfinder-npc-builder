#Pathfinder NPC Builder Old

Version 1.1

Creates interesting NPC stat blocks for Pathfinder RPG. Really useful for the GM on the go. Helps in a pinch when:

* Need some stats for a random traveller
* Players decide they DO want to fight the guard captain
* Want a slightly more interesting goblin to throw into the mix.

This was an old project from a couple years back before I knew anything about GIT and was frantically trying to learn how to use jQuery. Recovered from a dropbox.

Visually reeks of early nineties. But, apparently people were using it.
